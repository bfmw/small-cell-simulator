## Overview:

Paper Notation:
S_fancy_n = available sets of subchannels (set space)
S_n = subset of {1,2,...,K}, |S_n| = K_n
K_n = number of subchannels assigned to eNB n
K = total number of subchannels
Q_n(k) = vector of probabilities for choosing set k of S_fancy_n

## Todo:
- [] Fix SINR calculate to include fading, and fading per subchannel
- [] Fix bandwidth numbers
