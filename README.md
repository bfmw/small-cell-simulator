## Creating Simulations
Simulations have two pieces:  
1. The initial setup configuration
2. The system dynamics, which is basically how the simulation will run over time

Each simulation is located in the simulations folder and will contain 3 files in its subfolder.  The configuration, dynamic function, and documentation file describing the simulation.
